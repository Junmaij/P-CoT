Explanation:
The grapheme sequence ""beaked"" consists of three separate parts: ""bea"", ""e"", and ""d"".

1. ""bea"" is pronounced as /biː/ in American English.
2. The single letter ""e"" is silent in this context.
3. The letter ""d"" is pronounced as a voiced alveolar plosive /d/ in American English.

Therefore, the phoneme transcription for the word ""beaked"" is /biːkd/.",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

The word ""diaphragm"" is pronounced as three syllables: di-a-gram. Each syllable is pronounced as follows:

1. /dɪ/ - The first syllable is pronounced as the ""d"" sound followed by the short ""i"" sound.
2. /ə/ - The second syllable is the schwa sound, which is a neutral vowel sound represented by the letter ""e"" in words like ""about,"" ""again,"" and ""butter",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

Explanation:
The grapheme sequence ""veiny"" can be broken down into two parts: ""vein"" and the suffix ""-y"". The word ""vein"" is pronounced as /viːn/ in American English. The suffix ""-y"" typically changes the preceding vowel sound to a schwa (/ə/) when it is added to the end of a word. In this case, the schwa is pronounced before the final ""n"" sound in ""vein"", resulting in the phoneme sequence /ˈviːni/.",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

Explanation:
The grapheme sequence ""wailer"" can be broken down into three parts: ""wai"", ""l"", and ""er"".

1. ""wai"": The letter ""w"" represents the /w/ sound, as in ""water"".
2. ""l"": The single letter ""l"" represents the /l/ sound, as in ""lake"".
3. ""er"": The sequence ""er"" represents the /ər/ diphthong, as in ""her"" or ""per"".
